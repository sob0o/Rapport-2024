The healthcare industry faces challenges in essential areas like electronic record management, data integration, and computer-aided diagnoses and disease predictions. It is necessary to reduce healthcare costs and the movement towards personalized healthcare. The rapidly expanding fields of deep learning and predictive analytics has started to play a pivotal role in the evolution of large volume of healthcare data practices and research. Deep learning offers a wide range of tools, techniques, and frameworks to address these challenges. Health data predictive analytics is emerging as a transformative tool that can enable more proactive and preventative treatment options. In a nutshell, this paper focus on the framework for deep learning data analysis to clinical decision making depicts the study on various deep learning techniques and tools in practice as well as the applications of deep learning in healthcare.},

  abstract = {Lots of learning tasks require dealing with graph data which contains rich relation information among elements. Modeling physics systems, learning molecular fingerprints, predicting protein interface, and classifying diseases demand a model to learn from graph inputs. In other domains such as learning from non-structural data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures (like the dependency trees of sentences and the scene graphs of images) is an important research topic which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are neural models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. In recent years, variants of GNNs such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), graph recurrent network (GRN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performances on many deep learning tasks. In this survey, we propose a general design pipeline for GNN models and discuss the variants of each component, systematically categorize the applications, and propose four open problems for future research.}
